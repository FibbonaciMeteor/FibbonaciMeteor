<strong><u>PETITION FOR DRIVER'S LICENSE RESTORATION</u></strong>

<strong> </strong>

NOW COMES the above-named Petitioner, KEVIN AARON LANDAU, and shows unto this Honorable Court as follows:
<ol>
 	<li>That your Petitioner resides at 980 James K Blvd., in the City of Pontiac, County of Oakland, and State of Michigan, Driver's License No. 1,530 465 028 696.</li>
 	<li>That on June 8, 2014, your Petitioner's driving privileges were revoked by Order of the Secretary of State for the State of Michigan from June 9, 2014 through indefinite. A copy of the Secretary of State/s Order of Revocation is attached hereto and marked Exhibit "A".</li>
 	<li>That this revocation was based upon an occurrence on May 2, 2014, the first full day Petitioner had the interlock ignition device jn his vehicle.</li>
 	<li>A “rolling retest" violation was recorded on said date for the following reasons as indicated on the interlock device's computer generated report: "abort sucking', "abort humming”. A copy the Report is attached hereto and marked Exhibit “B”.</li>
 	<li>Petitioner suffers from chronic asthma, but remains fully compliant with all of his previously imposed conditions. Petitioner's asthmatic condition made the blowing requirements for this device very difficult. Letters from Petitioners physician and medical professionals are attached hereto and collectively marked, Exhibit "C".</li>
 	<li>On May 2, 2014, Petitioner was experiencing difficulty in mastering the device's blowing requirements and immediately returned to the vender's location where the device was installed the previous day. Petitioner requested additional instruction from the technician and has been without incident ever since. A copy of the letter verifying Petitioner's return to the vendor's office is attached hereto and marked Exhibit "D".</li>
 	<li>This violation was merely a result of either the device's internal malfunction, or the mechanical difficulties associated with a brand new piece of equipment- WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays:</li>
 	<li>That an order be entered requiring Respondent, Secretary of State for the State of Michigan, to appear before this Honorable Court to show cause, if any, they may have why the revocation of Petitioner's suspension of Petitioner's driving privileges should not be set aside.</li>
 	<li>That an order be entered restoring Petitioner's driver's license on a restricted basis in the same manner as previously provided for by the Respondent, both during the pendency of this matter and after said hearing on the show cause for all purposes allowed by MCL 257.3236).</li>
 	<li>And your Petitioner shall ever pray, etc.</li>

RE: KEVr<sup>s</sup>1 LANDAU

June 5, 2014

To Whom It May Concern:

Please be advised that Kevin Landau has demonstrated continuous sustained full sobriety since March 26, 2011. He has remained very well focused on his sober lifestyle and professional goals. Mr. Landau has remained fully cooperative with treatment and everything that has been asked of him, in order to remain fully compliant. Mr. Landau showed me the report he received that appears to reflect difficulty with the interlock device on his vehicle for the date of May 2, 2014. I believe that Mr. Landau has remained fully sober and that his intent was

to cooperate with that screening. As the device was new to him, I believe it is possible that he was still learning how to use it, that his asthma might have impeded that effort, or that there was a misread by the device. It would be incongruent with Mr. Landau's demeanor and history for him to have been uncooperative with the expectation for him to appropriately use the interlock device. Mr. Landau has been doing very well in therapy and his o   continued full compliance is anticipated. It is hoped that the aberration of that one date will be viewed within the context of a clearly ongoing successful recovery. As Mr. Landau remains mindful of his recovery needs, his prognosis remains excellent. Should you need to reach me, with appropriate consent, my direct line is 248 6335003.

Sincerely,

Psychotherapist/Behavioral Health Therapist
