  (P16381) Attorney for Defendant 29777 Telegraph, Suite 2500 Southfield, MI
  48034 (248) 948-0893 _________________________________/ MOTION FOR
  RECONSIDERATION NOW COMES Defendant. KEVIN AARON LANDAU. By and through his
  attorney. ARTHUR H. LANDAU, and in support of his motion for reconsideration
  of this Court’s Order affirming the 48th District Court’s Order denying
  defendant an evidentiary hearing on the admissibility of Datamaster results
  and on the officer’s failure to advice Defendant of his chemical test rights,
  says as follows: 1. This is an OUIL case, presently pending in 48th District
  Court before Judge Diane Dickow D’Agostini. 2. On March 28, 2007. Defendant
  filed a Claim of Appeal in Oakland County Circuit Court from the trial court’s
  Order of March 22, 2007. Denying defendant’s motion for an evidentiary hearing
  relative to the evidential breath alcohol test and defendant’s assertion that
  he was not advised of his chemical test rights. 3. The Honorable Rac Lee
  Chabot, Oakland County Circuit Court Judge, on April 2, 2007, ordered a stay
  of proceeding in 48th District Court until this appeal has been decided. 4. On
  April 18, 2007, Judge Chabot granted defendant’s application for leave to
  appeal. 5. On May 15, 2007, defendant filed a Brief with Judge Chabot an
  November 29, 2007. After oral argument. Judge Chabot denied defendant’s appeal
  of the decision of 48th District Court denying an evidentiary hearing. 6. As
  part of the Court’s decision of November 29, 2007, a 90 day stay of
  proceedings was granted to pursue an appeal. 7. At the hearing before this
  Court on November 29, 2007, Judge Chabot cited the case of People v Anstev,
  475 Mich 436 (2006), as requiring this Court to deny Defendant’s appeal. 8. On
  January 24, 2008, the Court of Appeals issued the following Order, which is
  attached to this motion. “The Court orders that the application for leave to
  appeal is denied for failure to persuade the Court of the need for immediate
  appellate review.” 9. However, in People v Anstey, supra. At page 450, the
  Supreme Court held that when a Defendant argues before trial that he or she
  was deprived of a reasonable opportunity for an independent chemical test, the
  trial court must determine after an evidentiary hearing if necessary, whether
  defendant was deprived of this statutory right and if there was a violation to
  inform the jury of the violation and instruct the jury to determine the weight
  to give to it. 10. The Supreme Court in Anstey at page 450, held; “The jury
  should be permitted to weigh the police officer’s wrongful conduct as well as
  the statutory right that the officer denied. When the defendant argues before
  trial that he or she was deprived of a reasonable opportunity for an
  independent chemical test, the trial court must determine, after an
  evidentiary hearing if necessary, whether the defendant was in fact deprived
  of this statutory right. If the court determines that a statutory violation
  occurred, then it is free, upon request of defense counsel, to inform the jury
  of this violation and instruct the jury that it may determine what weight to
  give to this fact. Such a jury instruction is an appropriate consequence for
  the violation of a mandatory statutory right to a reasonable opportunity for
  an independent chemical test because it will accord meaning to the right
  created test because it will accord meaning to the right created in
  subscription 6(d) without creating a remedy that the Legislature did not
  intend. A jury instruction will also presumably deter police officers from
  violating that right in the future.” 11. As such, Anstey, supra, addresses the
  need for an evidentiary hearing prior to trial to determine if a Defendant has
  been deprived of his statutory right to be advised that he has a reasonable
  opportunity for an independent chemical test by someone of his own choosing.
  Defendant has asserted from the beginning of this case that he was never
  advised of his chemical test rights by the police officer. 12. In addition, it
  appears that Anstey does not address whether an evidentiary hearing should be
  held in order to establish a proper foundation for admission of Datamaster
  results. 13. Defendant contends that it is a critical right of Defendant to
  have an evidentiary hearing prior to trial at which Defendant may challenge
  any chemical tests performed on him at the time of his arrest and whether he
  was advised of his chemical test rights. Without such an evidentiary hearing
  it is impossible for Defendant to properly prepare for trial. 14. The Court of
  Appeals in the instant case said it was premature to appeal at the present
  time, leaving in to Oakland County Circuit Court and 48th District Court to do
  justice. If Defendant is denied an evidentiary hearing on these issues prior
  to trial, he will have no reasonable opportunity to prepare for and have a
  fair trial in 48th District Court, and it will be too late for any meaningful
  appellate review. 15. Even this Court in its decision on November 29, 2007,
  denying Defendant’s request for an evidentiary hearing prior to trial in
  referring to Anstey, agrees with Defendant saying, “Sounds crazy to me but
  that’s the law.” 16. However, Anstey does provide Defendant with the right to
  an evidentiary hearing on these issues. 17. In the event this Honorable Court
  denies Defendant’s motion, defendant respectfully requests the opportunity to
  file an Application for Leave to Appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, citing
  the Anstey case and respectfully requests a further stay of proceedings while
  Defendant exhausts his appellate remedies to the Michigan Supreme Court.
  WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully request that his motion be granted.
