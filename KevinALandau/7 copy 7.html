11.	In response to the allegations in paragraph eleven of Defendant’s motion, the People neither admit nor deny the allegations contained in this paragraph, as the Court Rules speak for themselves.

22.	In response to the allegations in paragraph twenty two of Defendant’s motion, the People ask that this Court deny Defendant’s requested relief. 

WHEREFORE, Jessica R. Cooper. Prosecuting Attorney in and for the County of Oakland, by Jeffrey M. Kaelin, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court deny Defendant’s Motion in its entirety.
