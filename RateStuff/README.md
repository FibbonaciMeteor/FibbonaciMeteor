# RateStuff

A simple web app that assists in choosing a rating score.

## You like art,

you have opinions, you want to write them down and post them, but every website makes you enter a single number as summary of your very nuanced, deep, and complex feelings. As the enlightened, excellent, beautiful, intelligent, and humble critic that you are, how could you possibly do your opinion, and the art, such a disservice?!

## This app will help

by providing a series of sliders for you to customize and weight as you see fit.

Your critique will always be the last word, but now you can sleep easy knowing that these philistine consumers you share the internet with, will at least receive your guidance via an accurately correlated score.
